          There are several thousand celebrities and creators on twitter,
          tiktok, Instagram and YouTube with followings in the millions who we
          would be actively engaging before we go viral. We would get them on
          our platform and they would see the opportunity to create a fan driven
          digital economy where their digital content can be traded as NFTs and
          their most loyal fans can have the monetary value of their creator's
          currency increase significantly as they promote their digital currency
          across their channels while our native token holders benefit from the
          Weentar popularity.

        Bitcoin was the first, and it has since grown to thousands of tokens
        launched all aiming to fix one problem or the other with some quite
        simply FOMOing the moment. Our goal is to bring mass adoption to the
        cryptocurrency space by dumbing it down. How far down? So down that even
        a celebrity can explain it in simple words to their followers and have
        them download an app, buy into the social currency of their favourite
        person and watch their investment as is with other crypto currency
        project.
